## ¬©Ô∏è DMCA & Copyright Notice

**Historical Data Breaches Archive (`archive.trace.rip`)** is a publicly accessible, non-commercial research archive that indexes and references historical data breach records **for academic, journalistic, and cybersecurity research purposes only**.

### Important Clarifications

- **We do not host, store, distribute, or control any of the underlying breach data files.**  
- **`archive.trace.rip` and `vault.trace.rip` (FileBrowser Quantum) are technically and operationally distinct services.** Although they share a common domain root (`trace.rip`), **the Historical Data Breaches Archive (`archive.trace.rip`) does NOT host, operate, or have access to the contents of `vault.trace.rip`.**  
- All indexed breach records are sourced from publicly reported incidents and are presented solely as **metadata** (e.g., breach name, date, source URL, file hashes). **No actual compromised user data is stored or served by this archive.**

### Takedown Requests

Since we do not host any infringing content ourselves, **all DMCA takedown notices must be directed to the original hosting platforms** where the files are physically stored. We cannot remove content we do not control or possess.

However, if you are a copyright holder or authorized representative and believe your rights have been violated:

- We will gladly provide the **original source URL or hosting location** where the content was publicly referenced.  
- Upon receipt of a **valid, properly formatted DMCA notice**, we will review and, if applicable, **remove or disable access to the metadata reference** in our archive within our technical capabilities.

We respect intellectual property rights and comply with the safe harbor provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Our service functions as an **indexing and referencing tool only**, not as a content host.
