In August 2018, the Roblox trading site Rbx.Rocks suffered a data breach. Almost 25k records were sent to HIBP in November and included names, email addresses and passwords stored as bcrypt hashes. In July 2019, a further 125k records emerged bringing the total size of the incident to 150k. The website has since gone offline with a redirect to Rolimons.
